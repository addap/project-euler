; keep track of depth, start at depth 1, each node can reach the nodes at
; indices (+ self_index (triangle-number depth) [1])
; put neighbors in open list, according to their movement-cost+heuristic
; heuristic could be (- max_depth depth)
; read up on A* on Wikipedia
; if I use A* I need to specify an end node, so I will have to do max_depth searches
; I can't really give it a good heuristic, the numbers are more or less random
; If I'd do a heuristic like above, it would be too optimistic and A* couldn't leave out any nodes as it would never find a shorter path
; Djikstra's would be the better choice I think, but would it scale to Problem 60?
; Doesn't matter, it said this problem could still be brute-forced, just do Djikstra
;
; First convert the list to an appropriate graph, or just work with indices
; takes in a list with (triangle-number n) items and produces one with n sublists.
; The sublists have 1, 2, 3, ... items each
